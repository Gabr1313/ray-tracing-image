Ray tracer writte in c. Take a look at [input.txt](input.txt).

In order to use the denoiser compile 
[OIDN](https://github.com/OpenImageDenoise/oidn). Than copy `.so` files in 
`/usr/lib/` and `include/OpenImageDenoise/` in `/usr/include/`, or do the way 
you prefer (maybe modifying the [Makefile](./Makefile)).
